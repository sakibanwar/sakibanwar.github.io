## Teaching Philosophy

My teaching approach emphasizes the practical application of economic theory through real-world examples and experimental methods. I believe that economics is best understood when students can see how theoretical concepts apply to actual decision-making situations.

## Course Materials

All course materials, including lecture slides, reading lists, and assignments, are available through the university's learning management system. I also maintain supplementary resources on GitHub for my programming and data analysis courses.
